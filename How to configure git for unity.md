## Installing Unity

GCO recomends managing unity installs with unity hub.  If you know you don't use unity hub you can skip this step.

### Unity Hub
Visit https://unity3d.com/get-unity/download and download Unity Hub. ***The download button is to the right of the standard unity install***.  Once downloaded launch the executable and follow the installation wizard.

### Unity Game Engine
Visit https://unity3d.com/get-unity/download/archive and download the appropriate version of Unity for your organization by clicking the "**Unity Hub**" button. ***In this case we will use Unity 2019.1.4f1 as our example***.  Allow the webpage to open Unity Hub.  Then simply complete the installation and follow any prompts from Unity Hub.
