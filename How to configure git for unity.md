## Installing Unity

GCO recomends managing unity installs with unity hub.  If you know you don't use unity hub you can skip this step.

### Unity Hub

Visit 
[Download Unity Hub!](https://unity3d.com/get-unity/download)
and download Unity Hub. ***The download button is to the right of the standard unity install***.  Once downloaded launch the executable and follow the installation wizard.

### Unity Game Engine

Visit 
[Download Game Engine!](https://unity3d.com/get-unity/download/archive)
and download the appropriate version of Unity for your organization by clicking the "**Unity Hub**" button. ***In this case we will use Unity 2019.1.4f1 as our example***.  Allow the webpage to open Unity Hub.  Then simply complete the installation and follow any prompts from Unity Hub.

## Installing Git CLI and LFS

### Git
Download then install 
[Git CLI!](https://git-scm.com)
***Note that on windows some GCO members prefer to use git from CMD.EXE.  If you would like this make sure to select it at installation***
